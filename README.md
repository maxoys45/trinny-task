# React Testing Playground

There are a number of tasks for you to try and solve, each one presents itself as a bug that needs fixing.

We wanted to give you a chance to show off your skills but in a way that would reflect working with an existing (imperfect) code base.

Feel free to alter this playground as much as you want, add libraries or take them away.

Please feel free to refactor any (and all) of the code in this project, in fact we encourage it.

Spend as much or as little time as you deem fit playing, solving and improving this playground.

To start the test run ```yarn start``` this will spin up a local json server which can be found at
```http://localhost:3001/example``` which will be used for question two. It will also spin up react app at ```http://localhost:3000```

Questions can be reached in the React app, via the burger icon in the top left, and an error will be displayed in both the browser and in the browsers console.

Currently there are no tests written for the questions, please feel free to add some if you have time. Tests can be run via ```yarn test```
